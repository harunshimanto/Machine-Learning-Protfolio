# Machine-learning-RoadMap

[Machine Learning is the](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/machine-learning/) field of study that gives computers the ability to learn
without being explicitly programmed.
â€”Arthur Samuel, 1959


Repository containing a portfolio of machine learning projects and weekly progress towards becoming better at Machine Learning algorithms.

# Week 1

### Pick a language, and in my opinion, Python is the best for this. 
Why? Easy syntax, extensive documentation, great community, availability of resources. 

### Create a GitHub profile and learn Git

Git is a powerful version control system that every single person in the STEM field should learn. GitHub is a way of showing the world you know something. Simply writing, I know Python will not be enough for companies. You have to prove you know the Python by showing your projects.
